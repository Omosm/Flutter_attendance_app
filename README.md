# Flutter Attendance App

This is a simple flutter application to view attendance records.

It allows users to manage attendance records. The app displays the records in the form of a list view that is sorted based on the time. The list of records is sorted from the most recent to the oldest, and the time format is displayed in the format of "time ago" (e.g., 1 hour ago).

Users can also toggle the time format to be displayed in another format, "dd MMM yyyy, h:mm a", and this setting is persisted even if the app is terminated or killed. Users can add a new attendance record to the list, and when a record is successfully added, an indicator is displayed to show that the action was completed successfully.

Users can search through the list based on a keyword, and they can also view a particular record in another page. When the user reaches the end of the list, an indicator informs them that they have reached the end.

The app includes an introduction screen that educates new users on how to use the app, and users can share the contact information from the attendance records to other applications that are installed.
